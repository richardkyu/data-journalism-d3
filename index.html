						<h2>Analysis:</h2>
						<h3>Education Level vs. Oral Health in those aged 65+</h3>
						<li>
							Studying the relationship between proportion of individuals with all teeth missing and education level in elderly populations, 
							it was found that there was a negative correlation of about r= -0.72, which suggests a negative correlation between education and
							teeth missing. In other words, the higher the education, the less proportion of individuals with all their teeth missing at 65 years of age
							within the state. This may be due to a number of factors, such as those with higher education having greater means to care for their oral
							health, or just greater awareness in general, but it is hard to draw conclusions about causation from correlation.
						</li><br/>
						<h3>Race and Skin Cancer</h3>
						<li>
							Some studies suggest that individuals who are considered white by race may be more prone to skin cancer than other races. The basis of this idea
							lies in the fact that white individuals, by definition, usually have less melanin than black individuals and would thus be more exposed to the 
							effects of UV radiation. We found a correlation of r = 0.48, which is a mildly positive relationship, but not very conclusive at all.
						</li><br/>
						<h3>Food Stamp Status and Smoking</h3>
						<li>
							For these two characteristics, we found a r= 0.43 correlation. Again, it makes sense that there would not be much correlation between families
							getting food stamps and those smoking for a variety of reasons. In the first place, the comparison is between different measures of people in the population,
							families in comparison to individuals. So there is a differing degree of resolution in the comparison itself (i.e. children in families where the
							head of house is smoking likely aren't smoking, but if their parents are on foodstamps, they are considered to be on foodstamps because they are part of the families.)
